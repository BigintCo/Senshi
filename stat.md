STAT SYSTEM

In the Senshi universe, every warrior is defined by five core attributes. These attributes determine the warrior’s effectiveness in battle, crafting, exploration, and spiritual encounters. Upon minting, each Senshi receives a fixed pool of 140 stat points, distributed based on the chosen Spirit Archetype. This system ensures fairness while allowing strategic variance and identity.

Core Attributes

Strength (STR)
Measures raw physical power. Increases melee damage, determines the ability to wield heavy weapons and armor.

Agility (AGI)
Controls reflexes and flexibility. Affects dodge rate, attack speed, and success in agility-based missions.

Soulforce (SOUL)
Represents the Senshi's spiritual energy. Powers magic, spirit-based techniques, and provides resistance against Yamiyo corruption.

Wisdom (WIS)
Reflects knowledge, intuition, and mental clarity. Influences crafting success, ritual effectiveness, and ability to decode ancient recipes.

Speed (SPD)
Defines the tempo of a warrior’s actions. Reduces mission durations, increases turn priority, and enhances initiative in battle.

Total Starting Points: 140
All Senshi begin with a total of 140 points distributed across these five stats. Players select a Spirit Archetype during minting, which determines the initial distribution. No archetype has more or less than 140 points total.

This stat system is central to Senshi progression. In Phase 1, players must leverage their stat profile to complete daily tasks, unlock hidden crafting recipes, and prepare for the battles to come. While the base stat total is fixed, enhancements through equipment, relics, or ascension will allow further growth in later phases.
