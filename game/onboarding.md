**Senshi Phase 1 – Web Onboarding Design**

**Objective:**
Introduce new players to the Senshi universe and guide them through the process of minting their first character by choosing a Spirit Archetype. This onboarding occurs during Phase 1, hosted on the Katana Chain.

---

**1. Welcome Screen**

- Fullscreen cinematic intro: animated Torii gate, Yamiyo veil visuals.
- Button: **“Begin Your Path”**

**2. Lore Introduction (Optional)**

- Scrollable or modal-based storytelling sequence:

  - The Veil
  - Rise of Darkness
  - Call of the Senshi

- Option to skip or proceed directly
- Button: **“Choose Your Spirit”**

**3. Spirit Archetype Selection**

- UI Layout: Carousel or card grid showing 5 Spirit Archetypes:

  - **Kazan (Fire)**
  - **Mizu (Water)**
  - **Kaze (Wind)**
  - **Yama (Earth)**
  - **Kōmyō (Light)**

Each card contains:

- Spirit symbol
- Stat distribution table (STR, AGI, SOUL, WIS, SPD)
- Flavor text and personality description
- On hover or select: subtle animation, glowing effect
- On click: card expands or flips to show full profile

**4. Confirm and Mint**

- Display chosen archetype and its stats
- Connect wallet (Katana Chain compatible)
- Button: **“Mint Your Senshi”**
- After mint:

  - NFT revealed with background based on spirit type
  - Auto-generated name or user-defined
  - Character details and metadata visible
  - Button: **“Enter the Realm”**

**5. Main Interface – The Realm**
After minting, the player is taken to the main hub of the game, referred to as **The Realm**.

- The selected Senshi appears center stage in idle animation (floating cloth, subtle breathing, spirit aura)
- The environment reflects their Spirit Archetype color and theme
- Ambient effects enhance the sense of immersion (drifting petals, falling mist, pulsing sigils)

**Main Menu Navigation (typically floating or radial UI):**

- **Daily Quests** – Access missions and earn elemental rewards
- **Inventory** – View collected elements, gear, and crafted items
- **Crafting Lab** – Combine elements into weapons, armor, or spells
- **Leaderboard** – View global player progression
- **Profile** – View stats, spirit type, progression, and achievements

This area is designed to feel like a calm dojo or sacred training ground between battles. From here, all Phase 1 activity is launched.
